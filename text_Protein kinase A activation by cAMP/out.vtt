00:00.000 --> 00:09.280
CAMP, produced by adenylate cyclase G-protein interactions, binds regulatory subunits of

00:09.280 --> 00:14.320
PKA, protein kinase A, a tetramer.

00:14.320 --> 00:22.040
CAMP binding causes the catalytic subunits of PKA to dissociate and activate target proteins

00:22.040 --> 00:24.720
by phosphorylating them.

00:24.720 --> 00:30.120
These catalytic subunits may perform this task many times, amplifying the original stimulus

00:30.120 --> 00:31.760
signal.

00:31.760 --> 00:37.200
The final cellular response may range from glycogen metabolism to controlling transcription.
