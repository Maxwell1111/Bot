CAMP, produced by adenylate cyclase G-protein interactions, binds regulatory subunits of
PKA, protein kinase A, a tetramer.
CAMP binding causes the catalytic subunits of PKA to dissociate and activate target proteins
by phosphorylating them.
These catalytic subunits may perform this task many times, amplifying the original stimulus
signal.
The final cellular response may range from glycogen metabolism to controlling transcription.
