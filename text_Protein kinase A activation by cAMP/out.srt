1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,280
CAMP, produced by adenylate cyclase G-protein interactions, binds regulatory subunits of

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,320
PKA, protein kinase A, a tetramer.

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:22,040
CAMP binding causes the catalytic subunits of PKA to dissociate and activate target proteins

4
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,720
by phosphorylating them.

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,120
These catalytic subunits may perform this task many times, amplifying the original stimulus

6
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,760
signal.

7
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:37,200
The final cellular response may range from glycogen metabolism to controlling transcription.
